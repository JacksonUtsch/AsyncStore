# AsyncStore

Redux based architecture package for Swift 5.5 using async/await.

By using 5.5's concurrency features we do not have to depend on Combine and can target non-Apple platforms such as Linux and Windows.

Inspired by TCA ([The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture))
